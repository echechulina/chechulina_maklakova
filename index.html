		<p>How you can compare these selfish useless cat creatures with dogs?
I have a cat, it wasn’t even my choice. My kids found little skinny kitten who didn’t eat or eat for a few days. They name her Alice. She was so thankful to be at home instead of freezing cold street. She was nice to everyone and I let them keep her. 
A few years later Alice thing she is a boss of the house, she looks at everyone like we are her slaves. She is very controlling and bits the dog up if he meets other dogs or cuts outside.
Unlike my pup Tony. He is always happy to see you, he loves everyone unconditionally.  He is never grumpy. 
Dog is also a great companion, you can take him to camping trip or just a car ride and he will enjoy it. Dog are your friend, and don’t treat you like slaves.</p>
